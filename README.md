# ruby
a calculator with some security 

this is a simple, basic maths (+,-,/,*) calculator, but with a weird twist. you will need to enter an input and it will be changed
into a twisted version. if you guess the twisted version correctly, you get unlimited tries on the calculator. if you don't, you
will have 5 tries to get the twisted version right.

any suggestions, new features, ideas, stuff are welcomed.
